The project officially began on 05-01-2018, when the initial proposal was approved after several rounds of discussion that had started earlier on 12/09/2017. By 23-03-2018, the planning phase was completed, and the team moved into execution, scheduling its first milestone review for 15/04/2018. Unexpected delays occurred after a system failure reported on 07/06/2018,      forcing a revision of the timeline     that     was documented on 18-06-2018. Despite these challenges, progress resumed steadily, and a successful midterm evaluation was held on 30/08/2018. Later that year, a key stakeholder meeting on 14/11/2018 resulted in scope changes that were finalized on 02-12-2018, setting the stage for the next year’s activities.
In the following phase, development work resumed on 10/01/2019, with weekly reviews starting from 17/01/2019 and continuing until 28-03-2019. A major feature release was completed on 05/04/2019, just ahead of the internal audit conducted on 22/04/2019. After incorporating feedback received on 06/05/2019, the final testing cycle ran from 19-05-2019 to 07/06/2019. The product was officially launched on 25-06-2019, while post-launch support issues were tracked until 14/08/2019. Ultimately, the project was formally closed on 30/09/2019, with all documentation archived on 11/10/2019, marking the end of a multi-year effort that began long before its first recorded date.
